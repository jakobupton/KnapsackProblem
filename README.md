# Knapsack Problem

Given **N** items where each item has some weight and profit associated with it and also given a bag with capacity **W**, [i.e., the bag can hold at most **W** weight in it]. The task is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of profits associated with them is the maximum possible. 


## Instructions for Running
1. Clone the Repository: ```git clone https://github.com/jakobupton/KnapsackProblem```
2. Open to the index.html in your browser.
3. Enter some values for capacity, # of items, followed by weights and values for each item.
    Some suggested values could be 5 items, with a capacity of 10.
    1. Value: 5, Weight: 1
    2. Value: 3, Weight: 2
    3. Value: 5, Weight: 4
    4. Value: 3, Weight: 2
    5. Value: 2, Weight: 5
4. The program will step through the algorithm, comparing the max value at each step, presenting the optimal solution once finished.
   
## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming is **O(N*W)**, where **N** is the number of items and **W** is the capacity of the knapsack. The space complexity is also **O(N*W)**.
